1.Missing number in array
2.Find duplicates in an array
3.Count pairs with given sum
    Given an array of N integers, and an integer K, find the number of pairs of elements in the array whose sum is equal to K.
    Example 1:

    Input:
    N = 4, K = 6
    arr[] = {1, 5, 7, 1}
    Output: 2
    Explanation: 
    arr[0] + arr[1] = 1 + 5 = 6 
    and arr[1] + arr[3] = 5 + 1 = 6.

    Example 2:

    Input:
    N = 4, K = 2
    arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1}
    Output: 6
    Explanation: 
    Each 1 will produce sum 2 with any 1.
4.First Repeating Element
    Given an array arr[] of size n, find the first repeating element. The element should occur more than once and the index of its first occurrence should be the smallest.

Note:- The position you return should be according to 1-based indexing. 

Example 1:

    Input:
    n = 7
    arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6}
    Output: 2
    Explanation: 
    5 is appearing twice and 
    its first appearence is at index 2 
    which is less than 3 whose first 
    occuring index is 3.

    Example 2:

    Input:
    n = 4
    arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
    Output: -1
    Explanation: 
    All elements appear only once so 
    answer is -1.
